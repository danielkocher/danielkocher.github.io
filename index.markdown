title: Daniel Kocher &mdash; Senior Scientist, Database Research Group (Department of Computer Science, University of Salzburg)
---

Welcome, my name is Daniel Kocher and I am a Senior Scientist at the <a href="https://www.plus.ac.at/fachbereich-informatik/">Department of Computer Sciences</a> at the the <a href="https://www.plus.ac.at">University of Salzburg</a> and recipient of the Early Career Fellowship. Currently, I mainly work with the <a href="https://dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at">Database Research Group</a> of <a href="https://dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at/people/augsten">Prof. Nikolaus Augsten</a>.
<br /><br />
I pursued my Ph.D. in the area of similarity search in database systems with <a href="https://dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at/people/augsten">Nikolaus Augsten</a> as my advisor (<a href="https://dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at">Database Research Group</a>, <a href="https://www.plus.ac.at/fachbereich-informatik/">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.plus.ac.at">University of Salzburg</a>). In my cumulative dissertation &ndash; titled <em>"Scalable Similarity Queries over Complex Data"</em> &ndash;, I introduce novel efficient algorithms and data structures for top-<em>k</em> subtree similarity queries and density-based clustering for sets. Naturally, my research revolve around similarity search, efficient data structures, query processing, top-<em>k</em> queries, clustering techniques, and main-memory database systems. Furthermore, I am interested in performance and systems engineering, compilers, programming languages, and modern hardware (e.g., multi-core architectures and remote direct memory access).
