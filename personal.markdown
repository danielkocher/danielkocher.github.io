# Personal

## Paramedic

Since October 2021, I am a volunteer paramedic for the [Austrian Red Cross](https://www.roteskreuz.at/) in [Salzburg](https://www.roteskreuz.at/salzburg/home) and [Seekirchen/Eugendorf](https://www.roteskreuz.at/salzburg/flachgau/seekirchen-eugendorf) (which is my home town).
Due to my education, I am serving as technical assistent (if needed), and I am also responsible for the professional material.
Within this year, I plan to complete the _Stress treatment after intense rescue operations_ training in order to serve as peer for my colleagues.

## Sports

I enjoy hiking, cycling, and soccer, but also try to do some fitness if time allows it.
Since 2018, I regularly watch American Football.

## Psychology

As a hobby, I am interested into psychology and inter-personal communication.
To this end, I mainly follow podcasts but also read books on these topics to get new ideas that I can integrate into my daily routine.
