# Teaching

During my academic career, I taught courses and advised theses on (almost) all levels in the context of computer science.
I independently designed a course named _Distributed Information Management_, which is part of the interdisciplinary curriculum _Digitalization-Innovation-Society_ and the cross-factulty initiative _Computer Science Skills for All_ at the University of Salzburg.
Finally, I gained international teaching experience by teaching at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P).
